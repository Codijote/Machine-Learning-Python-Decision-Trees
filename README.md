Machine Learning Python Decision Trees

Suscint yet well structured exercise of machine learning using decision trees.

Datasets are also small but useful for learning purposes.

Code to be read mostly by following names and program.

# Exercise replication in base R
Tried to follow the same exercise over the same data set with R.

Used R base for the sake of performance loading only the 'tree' library for the tree() algorithm.

Although the intention was to replicate the same procedure with another language it is not that straight and some parts must be adapted to the language specifics, specially functions parameters and workflow.

One of the two languages provided a better performance and faster more precise results with no need to post-prune the tree.

However both languages make a different classification of the importance of the variable for the regression tree.
